# Love 愛

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

I can't believe that I thought it'd be easy

Well I guess that no one's perfect

I was deceived by a thing we call dreamin'

'Cause I thought I couldn't hurt it

Now look at me, it's so easy to see

Something's hidin' what I asked for

It's been years now

And I'm still seekin' it out

## 副歌

Maybe I'm only stuck

on my own cloud above

Maybe it's okay

maybe I'm insane

Maybe it's meant to be so tough

Ohhhhh, or maybe all I need is love

## 間奏

All I need is love

All I need is...

## 間奏

## 主歌-2

Once again, I can feel myself fadin'

I see a new life being colored in

I can tell that my heart is done achin'

But I wonder if I've gained another skin

I can't stop this transformation

An odd sensation's takin' me for a ride

All the way back through my mind

## 重複: 副歌

## 間奏

All I need is love

All I need is...

## 間奏

Love
