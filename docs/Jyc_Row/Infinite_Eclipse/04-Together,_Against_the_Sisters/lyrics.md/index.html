        <p>[CS]</p>
<p>Moon, enlighten the night,</p>
<p>the dark side of light,</p>
<p>I gave you devotion, my blood and my life.</p>
<p>I trusted your stars,</p>
<p>they were once my guide,</p>
<p>but now they are falling along with the...</p>
<p>[PW]</p>
<p>Sun, keeper of flame,</p>
<p>breaker of day,</p>
<p>I gave you my sword, my heart and my faith.</p>
<p>But now the sky is burning,</p>
<p>And I scream and wonder</p>
<p>when did your fire become so (cold)?</p>
<p>[PW]</p>
<p>Cold winds will come like a storm,</p>
<p>[BOTH]</p>
<p>destroying everything, everyone we love.</p>
<p>Time has come to recall,</p>
<p>the days of old,</p>
<p>when both, day and night, were bound by the dawn</p>
<p>[PW]</p>
<p>We are the mountains, the woods, the fields</p>
<p>[CS]</p>
<p>We are the rivers, the shore and the sea</p>
<p>[PW]</p>
<p>What's worth fighting for</p>
<p>[CS]</p>
<p>The reason to win</p>
<p>[BOTH]</p>
<p>our land, our home, the air we breath</p>
<p>[PW]</p>
<p>May thunder be our voice,</p>
<p>[CS]</p>
<p>With lightning in our veins,</p>
<p>[BOTH]</p>
<p>Our hearts our beating power, roaring our claim:</p>
<p>[PW]</p>
<p>"What lives beneath the sun,</p>
<p>[CS]</p>
<p>is written in the stars".</p>
<p>[BOTH]</p>
<p>Why can't you understand?</p>
<p>[BOTH]</p>
<p>One by one, we'll fight</p>
<p>Side by side, we'll fight</p>
<p>Together</p>
<p>[GUITAR SOLO]</p>
<p>[BOTH]</p>
<p>A new day shines, the storm has gone,</p>
<p>May rain wash away all the pain from our souls</p>
<p>Time has come for rebirth,</p>
<p>to rise like the sun,</p>
<p>From now, day and night, will be bound by the dawn</p>
    </body>
