# Here On The Moon 在這月球上

## 主歌-1

小馬鎮
Ponyville, I was in love with you
but I'm trying something new
Ya don't need me now
I knew it was too good to be true
I knew that we'd both lose
and you've let me down

## 副歌

It's time to say goodbye
'cause I've learned how to fly
Don't wanna see you anytime soon
All tension's thin out here
in this cool atmosphere
so, I'll be living here on the moon

La da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da

## 主歌-2

Look at me, trottin' here on my own
I mean, look how far I've flown
It's already growing on me
Come to think of it, you'll never see me again
Don't even ask me how I've been
and don't even think about me

## 樂器獨奏

Here On The Moon

## 橋段

This is no game of hide and seek
I guess I just need time to think
So, face the facts
'Cause I won't be back

## 副歌-2

## 重複: 副歌

I'm not playing hide and seek
I just need time to think
So I'll be thinking here on the moon

La da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da

La da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da
