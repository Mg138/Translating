# No Different 沒有區別

They say that the moon is a place that every astronaut dreams of going some day and I found myself no different.
I had also figured that being alone would be the answer to my jealousy.

It was perfect. I had found it; the place where I could be alone, but not truly lost.
The place I could be happy while away from my friends; where I could breathe my own air, sharing it with none.
