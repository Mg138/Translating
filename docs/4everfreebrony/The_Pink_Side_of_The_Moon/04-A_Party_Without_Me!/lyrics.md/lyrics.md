# A Party Without Me! 沒邀我的派對！

...哦... 他們怎麼可以！？
...oh... HOW COULD THEY!?

我，簡直，不敢，相信！
I. Can't. BELIEVE IT!!

他們開了派對沒邀我！沒邀 Pinkie!
They had a party without me! Without PINKIE!

唉，我—— 誰會這樣做！
I mean, you-- you just don't DO that!!

哼！
Hmmm!

但誰在乎呢？好像他們得遵守這些規則一樣...
But who cares? It's not like they need to follow that rule NOW...

嗯，我，Pinkamena Diane Pie, 定了這些規則。
I mean, I, Pinkamena Diane Pie, made the rule.

而如果我，Pinkamena Diane Pie, 不在那邊，那他們就不用遵守規則。
And if I, Pinkamena Diane Pie, am not there at all, then they won't HAVE to follow the rule.

這是個雙贏。他們在下面很好的話，我在，這邊，也很好！
It's a double-win. They're fine down THERE, and I am fine. Right. HERE!
