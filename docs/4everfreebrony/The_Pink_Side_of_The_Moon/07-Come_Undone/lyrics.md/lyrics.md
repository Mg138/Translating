# Come Undone 終將打開

## 獨白

我這一生從未錯得如此過。

I had never been so wrong before in my life.

<br>

僅僅因為我不能分享我呼吸的空氣

我那張逐漸下垂的笑臉就多了條煩惱的皺紋

For the fact alone that I couldn't share the air I breathed

brought an agonizing twitch in my slowly sinking smile.

<br>

儘管這聽起來很荒唐，我哭了。

I would go as far as to say, I started to cry.

<br>

我也只剩下哭了。

And that's just what I did.

<br>

轉瞬間，我明白了，把自己關在這裡

是個粗魯的決定，

Right then I had realized that trapping myself here

was a rather rash decision,

<br>

而命運不會容忍我。

and would not be tolerated by fate.

<br>

我的朋友沒了，如此，我的笑容也是。

My friends were gone, and therefore, so is my smile.

<br>

我向身旁的星星訴苦，但它們不回應。

I expressed my sorrow to the stars around me, but they wouldn't respond.

<br>

它們甚至不知道我的存在。

They didn't even acknowledge my presence.

<br>

朋友會，但我已經沒有了。

Friends would, but I didn't have those anymore.

<br>

我又哭了。

I cried again.

## 副歌

風暴席捲，在這牆內。

The storm is raging inside these walls.

<br>

心上打的詰，終將打開。

The knots of emotion will come undone.

<br>

終將打開。

Come undone.

<br>

終將打開。

Come undone.
