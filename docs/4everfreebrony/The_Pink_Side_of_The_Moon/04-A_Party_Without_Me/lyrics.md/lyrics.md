# A Party Without Me 沒有我的派對

...ohhhhhhhh HOW COULD THEY!?
I. Can't. BELIEVE IT!! They had a party without me! Without PINKIE!
I mean, you-- you just don't DO that!!
Hmmm!

But who cares? It's not like they need to follow that rule NOW...
I mean, I, Pinkamena Dianne Pie, made the rule.
And if I, Pinkamena Dianne Pie, am not there at all, then they won't HAVE to follow the rule.
It's a double-win. They're fine down THERE, and I am fine. Right. HERE!
