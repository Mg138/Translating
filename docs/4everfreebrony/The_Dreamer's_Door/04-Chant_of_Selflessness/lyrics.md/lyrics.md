# Chant of Selflessness 無私之歌

## 前奏

## 副歌

他相信道理簡單明瞭

One would believe in simple means

<br>

有人覺得也非不可能

Some would believe it possible

<br>

其他人則是漠不關心

Others feel it won't be seen

<br>

但沒人相信會有奇蹟

For none believe in miracles

<br>

有人用鑽石換碎石

有人用碎石換鑽石

Some give a diamond for a stone

Some give a stone for a diamond

<br>

有人守著自己的錢財

而也有人什麼都不說

Some keep all things for their own

And some remain in silence

## 間奏

## 主歌-1

純樸的古代，有位小女孩

皮毛與頭髮如晝夜般

There once lived a girl in a simpler time

with night-like hair and skin so white

<br>

不論她到哪，都對大家說

「雖是己所有，爾可當己用」

Wherever she went, everyone she'd tell

"What'd appear as mine, 'tis thine as well"

## 主歌-2

她旅行四方，捐出她所有

從來沒想過要拿回來

So she went through the world, giving all she had

never feeling the need to claim it back

<br>

不論她到哪，大家都臣服

「似是己所有，爾可當己用」

Everyone she'd meet would befall her spell

"What appears as mine, 'tis thine as well"

## 主歌-3

雖然她已時日不多

卻仍堅持大方作風

Counting the days of a shortening life

Living the ways of a nursery rhyme

<br>

哼聲有如鐘聲一般

雖是己所有，爾可當己用

Humming the tune of a ringing bell

What appears as mine, 'tis thine as well
