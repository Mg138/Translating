# Where Everything is New

Harmony is at

Wit's end

But can you feel my

heart against yours?

Surrounded

by unfamiliar faces

Only yours can

Bring me hope

They say that

Home is where the heart is

But my heart

Is split in two

You know me

Right from top to bottom

You know me

For who I am

You gotta smile smile smile

And it'll be okay

You just wait

On the road to friendship

The wounds we had will heal

We've come a long way

From the brokenness we were

The names they say

And the games they play

Ya, sticks and stones

But it's okay

We're on our way

On the road to

Life again

A great adventure's

Just beyond the place

Where everything

Is new

Oh, the possibilities

Brought by our imagination

I think we can work

To feel better

Because we're

Living off a dream of ours

A dream that's filled

With magic

A future filled

With hope again

We are so fragile

The lights we've known go dim

Our trot becomes a pace

As our lives transform anew

You gotta smile smile smile

And it'll be okay

You just wait

But it's okay

We're on our way

On the road to

Life again

A great adventure's

Just beyond the place

Where everything

Is new

All my life

All I've known

Is running

Away

Now I know

That I can stand

For myself

and for my friends

Can I be forgiven

In the place

Where everything

Is new?
