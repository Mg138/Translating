(chorus)
Innocence and clarity in one
Purity is only found in some
Lack of words in trickery or harm
Only from the bottom of the heart

(v1)
Learned it in a parable
Found it in a lullaby
Someone said it long ago
Dreamed it on a sleepless night
You can hear it whispering
Only if you're listening
Searching all your favored memories

(repeat chorus)

(v2)
Gone beyond the mountainside
Take a gander of your own
Nearer to the river's eyes
Beauty in the scene alone
I'll be waiting reverently
Underneath the apple tree
Pondering on what we're all to be

(repeat chorus)

Only from the bottom of the heart
