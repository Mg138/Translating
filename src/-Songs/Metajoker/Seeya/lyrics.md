# Seeya! 再會！

## 主歌-1

所以，就是這了吧
So here we are

最後的再見
the last goodbye

真想找到某種完美台詞
if only I could find some perfect phrase

來讓你笑
To make you laugh

來讓你哭
to make you cry

來在我消失前讓你開心
to bring you joy before I fade away

但說到底
But in the end

我們不過是
we're just pretend

在天黑前，曇花一現的點子
some fleeting thoughts before the dark of sleep

但我還有感受
But I can feel

所以我還在這
so I am real

那要不在太深之前逃離
so let's escape before we're in too deep

## 導歌-1

所以，帶
我回到一切的起點
So take
me back to where it all began

而如果你等會
你就能再一次收聽
And if you wait
then you will hear it all again

未來還很遙遠時
我心中的那片無知
The innocence in my heart
when I had all my life ahead

但我們不管唱多少歌
都有結尾
But every song that we start
it has to end

## 副歌

Woah...

就再一次舉起雙手
Raise your hands just one more time

Woah...

我們會在來生什麼的見面
I'll see you in some other life

Woah...

天空下著束束光線
The atmosphere is raining light

Woah...

我們會在來生什麼的見面
I'll see you in some other life

## 主歌-2

We're setting sail

across the sky

the constellations, they will be our guide

And suddenly

our promises

are just a melody that slipped our mind

But maybe we

will meet again

when all the stars align a path someday

But as we are // (setting sail)

the scattered stars

are spreading us across the Milky Way

## 導歌-2

Life's a party
pounding in a heartbeat

That's all I know

But if you
listen real close

every beat will heal those
scars on your soul

Cause, oh...

life, it hurts, but
in the end it's worth it

Joy through the tears

The years
they say goodbye

with memories that try to
end all your fears

End all your fears

## 重複: 副歌

## 間奏

Oh, I
am sailing on

I'm sailing on

Goodbye
to all I've known

To all I've known

And I will wait for you

## 尾奏

I'll whisper out across the galaxy

"I'll See you soon"

Woah...

I have changed
I have grown

Now I am
on my own...

Knowing, now,
who I'll be

I am free...
